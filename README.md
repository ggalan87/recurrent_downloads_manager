A tool to download recurrent content from webpages. Scheduling is not part of the tool.

The motivation about the tool was to automate a daily task that I had to do during military service, where I had to
download some content from the Internet and provide it to users of an internal network.

Currently supported functionality:
* Given a list of pairs of city names and URLs, download those pages as seperate PDF
* Download a map for fire risk from a specific URL
